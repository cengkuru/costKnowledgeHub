  - Replaced client-side user creation with Cloud Function createAdminUser that uses Firebase Admin SDK
  - Updated user-management.component.ts to call new cloud function instead of direct auth creation
  - Added proper error handling and validation for admin user creation via Cloud Function
  - **Problem**: When admin creates a user, createUserWithEmailAndPassword() automatically signs in the new user, logging out the admin
  - **Root Cause**: Firebase client SDK createUserWithEmailAndPassword() always signs in the newly created user account
  - **Solution**: Moved user creation to Cloud Function using Admin SDK which doesn't affect current authentication state
  - **Result**: Admins can now create users while maintaining their own authenticated session and permissions

## [Previous] - 2025-07-04 11:15:00 UTC

### Fixed - 2025-07-04 11:15:00 UTC

  - Removed unreliable setTimeout hack in favor of lifecycle-based rendering
  - Fixed TypeScript interfaces implementation (OnInit, AfterViewInit, OnDestroy)
  - **Problem**: Charts were not rendering due to querySelector looking for ID attributes that didn't exist
  - **Solution**: Added IDs to canvas elements and used Angular's ViewChild for proper DOM access
